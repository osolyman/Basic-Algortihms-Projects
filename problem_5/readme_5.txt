Implementing a trie data structure and related methods for inserting words 
into the trie and finding words with a given prefix. to do that we need to
implement a suffixes function in TrieNode.

for insertion:
                The Space Complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the word

                The Time Complexity is O(m), where m is the length of words.

for Find function:
                The Space Complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the word

                The Time Complexity is O(m), where m is the length of words.

for Suffixes:
                The Space Complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the word

                The Time Complexity is O(m), where m is the number of characters in suffixes of words.

Overall:

The Space Complexity is O(n*m), where n is the number of words and m is the length of the word.

The Time Complexity is O(m), where m is the length of words.
